Week 2 Group Assignment
Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher 
or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player 
guessed correctly. If the player guess correctly they gain 100 points, and if they are incorrect
they lose 75 poitns. The game ends if when the player's score reaches 0.
